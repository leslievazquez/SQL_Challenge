<h1 align ="center"><span>Employee Database:<br/>A Mystery in Two Parts</span></h1>

The purpose of this data analysis was to create an employee SQL database using pgAdmin PostgreSQL Tools based on six csv files from the mock company Pewlett-Hackard. 

### Data Modeling
The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created using the tool on the website [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).

### Data Analysis


Data collected from CSVs is then loaded to the SQL database and the following analysis questions are answered using SQL queries:

List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

List employees who were hired in 1986.

List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
